    <!-- Summary -->
    <string name="unbreakable_summary">I am confident in my capabilities to handle any task through dedication, vigilance, and
maintaining a sense of control. I take pride in being seen as dependable and strong, always ready
to face any challenge without showing vulnerability.</string>
    <string name="inspector_summary">In my relentless pursuit of excellence, I hold the firm belief that anything less than perfection
is unacceptable. I dedicate myself to achieving flawlessness in every aspect of my life, which breeds
guilt, shame, self-doubt, and a fear. The constant comparison to others while measuring my
circumstances against an idealized scenario fuels feelings of inadequacy, envy, and jealousy toward
those who have achieved success</string>
    <string name="savior_summary">Taking responsibility for the problems of others makes me feel valuable and distinctive. I
believe that if I don\'t help others, it implies that I don\'t care for or love them. I hold myself
accountable for the pain that my loved ones experience. I believe that caring excessively for others
increases my own self-worth.</string>
    <string name="rejected_summary">I erect emotional walls that prevent others from getting too close to me, hoping that this will
shield me from getting hurt. My self-esteem is linked to receiving approval from others, and I
forget that self- acceptance should come first. I hold onto relationships that are harmful to my
overall health and leave me feeling drained.</string>
    <string name="pessimist_summary">I focus on the most unfavorable possible outcomes of every situation. I give most of my
attention to the potential risks and negative aspects, while overlooking the possible benefits. I
believe that every good thing has an expiration date. I engage in negative self-talk and tend to
dismiss positive assumptions.</string>
    <string name="doer_summary">I frequently push myself beyond my physical limits, taking on tasks that exceed my capabilities,
and viewing rest as a waste of time, which hinders my growth and progress. My conviction that
my value is tied to my productivity. Yet, when I am unable to meet my lofty expectations, I
succumb to harsh self-criticism, trapped in the paradox of relentless achievement.</string>
    <string name="conformer_summary">I struggle to set healthy boundaries, often prioritizing the needs of others over my own, and
find validation in accommodating them, even at the expense of my well-being. I frequently engage
in conversations revolving around crises, and perceive challenges as overwhelming, often feeling
powerless and burdened by past traumas.</string>
    <string name="dreamer_summary">In order to avoid confronting my emotions, I turn to immediate gratification, such as
overeating, spending money, and binge-watching TV. These behaviors help distract me from my
reality. I have a tendency to think that if I feel sad, there must be something wrong with me. I hold
onto the belief that it is not appropriate to share my negative emotions with others.</string>

    <!-- Mental Models -->
    <string name="conformer_mental_model">Practice assertiveness by saying no to at least one request today, realizing that setting boundaries won\'t cause a disaster. Cultivate self-compassion, treat yourself with kindness and care, and discover your worth beyond sacrifices.</string>
    <string name="doer_mental_model">Foster a positive perspective. One way to do this is by identifying and acknowledging three\nthings you have achieved today, or throughout the year. Embracing this positive perspective\nempowers you to nurture your self-appreciation and find a sense of fulfilment along your journey\ntoward personal growth and success.</string>
    <string name="dreamer_mental_model">Instead of being overly optimistic as a means to avoid facing difficult emotions or truths, take\na moment to pause, sit down, and reflect on the emotion that you are feeling, even if it is\nuncomfortable. You may discover new opportunities or perspectives by allowing yourself to\nexperience and process the feelings that you have been avoiding.</string>
    <string name="inspector_mental_model">Challenge your all-or-nothing mentality and the black-and-white thinking associated with your\nperfectionism. Recognize that progress is a gradual process that includes both successes and\nsetbacks. Allow yourself to celebrate even the smallest successes and view your setbacks as\nopportunities for learning and growth.</string>
    <string name="pessimist_mental_model">Challenge your negative thoughts. When you notice cynical thoughts arising, ask yourself if\nthey are realistic and if there is evidence to support them.</string>
    <string name="rejected_mental_model">Focus on your capabilities. Remind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments. This can\nhelp boost your confidence and self-esteem.</string>
    <string name="savior_mental_model">Recognize your own needs. Start by identifying your needs and priorities. You cannot be an\neffective helper or rescuer if you are not taking care of yourself first.</string>
    <string name="unbreakable_mental_model">Embrace vulnerability with someone you trust by sharing small feelings or mistakes, and\ngradually work on opening up. Practice mindfulness to become aware of your thoughts, feelings,\nand bodily sensations without judgment, allowing you to forge a deeper connection with your\nemotions</string>
